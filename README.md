You will probably need to use the [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi) Chrome App to get around the cross-origin errors.

## Commands
```shell
yarn install      # install node_modules

yarn test:server  # start a server running the specs
```
